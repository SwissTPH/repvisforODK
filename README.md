# repvisforODK

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

**This package is currently under active development and has no MVP
yet.**

The goal of repvisforODK is to enable its users to quickly visualize data retrieved from ODK Central by offering a variety of plots for different question types.
Through the included Shiny app, this is also possible for users with little to no coding skills.

## Installation

At the moment you cannot install repvisforODK from
[CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org) because it has not been published yet.
When published installing will be possible through:

``` r
install.packages("repvisforODK")
```

However, the development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/) can be installed using:

``` r
require("devtools")
devtools::install_github("lucidviews/repvisforODK")
```

## Example

COMING SOON

``` r
library(repvisforODK)
## basic example code
