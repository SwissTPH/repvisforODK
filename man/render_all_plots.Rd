\description{
The rendered file is based on the all_plots.rmd template that comes with the package. It contains all plots that the package offers.
If you want to customize the markdown file before rendering it, you can access the template using \code{\link[rmarkdown]{draft}}.
For the latter, use the following arguments: file = 'INSERT_FILE_NAME', template = 'all_plots', package = 'repvisforODK, edit = TRUE'.
